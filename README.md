# Long_Intraday_Trend_Model

This project is a direct attempt to automate as much of my trading decisions as I see fit under different circumstances.

This program allows me autonomously to:
1) exit a trade based on a crude 1:2 reward (after manual entry)
2) exit a trade using overextended indicators (after manual or autonomous entry)
3) enter a trade and exit 
4) scan through trending stocks and filer them to show in play long play potentials

This program also now supports simulations for different technical analysis functions run in Risk_Reward.py file

Some of the pivotal libraries in this project: Selenium (+Splinter), TA, Pandas, Requests, Time 

Currently used APIs : TD Ameritrade, Finn Hub, StockTwits
